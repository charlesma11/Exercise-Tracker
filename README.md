# Exercise Tracker Project

This project was created with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and tracks exercise activities based on users logging their daily workouts. The project uses MongoDB to store the data and sends http requests via a basic frontend system implemented with React. Created with the help of free online materials.
